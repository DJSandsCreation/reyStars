  <h1>Star Wars</h1>

    <p>Rey Skywalker was a Force-sensitive human female who, after years of living as a scavenger, became a Jedi during
      the war between the First Order and the Resistance. Unaware of her lineage as the granddaughter of Emperor Sheev
      Palpatine, Rey was the only name she went by prior to assuming the Skywalker surname. Rey ultimately chose the
      Jedi path, despite inheriting her strength in the Force from a Dark Lord of the Sith. She also formed a unique
      bond with Supreme Leader Kylo Ren. Notwithstanding their adversarial relationship, Rey and Ren were the
      realization of a prophesied dyad in the Force</p>
    <p>Born in 15 ABY during the New Republic Era, Rey's parents left her on the planet Jakku in hopes of keeping her
      safe from the Emperor. Though Rey longed to be reunited with her mother and father, she learned to survive on her
      own. Toughened by her travails in the deserts of her homeworld, Rey became a skilled mechanic, pilot, and
      combatant during her time as a scavenger. Her isolation ended in 34 ABY as the cold war gave way to open conflict
      throughout the galaxy. Having sided with the Resistance, Rey formed new friendships with Finn, a renegade
      stormtrooper, as well as the veterans Han Solo and Chewbacca, drawing her deeper into the galactic war that ensued
      from the destruction of the New Republic. In the course of her journey Rey located the legendary Jedi Master Luke
      Skywalker who, despite his self-imposed exile on Ahch-To, trained her in the ways of the Jedi Order. After
      Skywalker sacrificed his life to save the Resistance, Rey assumed his mantle as the last Jedi and became the
      apprentice of General Leia Organa.</p>
    <p>With the return of Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord known to the galaxy as Emperor Palpatine, Rey set out to find the
      dark world of Exegol and prevent the Sith from being reborn. It was through Ren that Rey discovered her origins as
      the Emperor's granddaughter, and upon confronting Sidious in person, she was nearly swayed to the dark side of the
      Force. Rey was saved, however, by a redeemed Ben Solo, who ultimately renounced the dark persona of Kylo Ren.
      Aided by the spirits of all the Jedi, Rey died vanquishing her dark grandfather, causing Solo to make the ultimate
      sacrifice in order to bring Rey back to life. The two embraced and shared a kiss as Solo died peacefully in Rey's
      arms. Although Solo's death ended the Skywalker bloodline, Rey assumed the name "Skywalker" to honor their memory,
      repudiating her own heritage as a Palpatine.
